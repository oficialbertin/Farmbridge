## Executive Summary
FarmBridge AI is a smart agricultural commerce platform designed to connect local farmers—especially those dealing in perishable produce like fruits and vegetables—directly with buyers such as hotels, restaurants, vendors, and urban markets. By leveraging technologies like **USSD**, **MTN Mobile Money**, and **AI-based pricing/demand forecasting tools**, the platform aims to:
- Reduce dependency on middlemen.
- Increase farmers’ income.
- Decrease produce spoilage.
- Ensure a more efficient and transparent agricultural supply chain in Rwanda.

---

## Background and Problem Statement
In Rwanda, smallholder farmers face challenges such as:
- Over-reliance on middlemen offering exploitative prices.
- Poor access to real-time market information.
- Lack of digital tools for offline or basic phone users.
- Inadequate payment systems leading to delays or unsafe transactions.

Urban buyers (hotels, restaurants, vendors) also struggle to source consistent, high-quality produce. This fragmented supply chain results in food waste and lost income for farmers. **FarmBridge AI Rwanda** addresses these gaps by building a centralized, inclusive, and intelligent platform.

---

## Project Objectives
- Empower farmers by giving them direct access to buyers through digital tools.
- Enable buyers to easily source fresh, local produce.
- Facilitate real-time payments through **MTN Mobile Money**.
- Ensure inclusion for non-smartphone users via **USSD**.
- Integrate **AI** for price guidance, forecasting, and matchmaking.

---

## Scope of Work
FarmBridge AI will deliver:
- A **USSD System** for farmers to list crops and check payment status.
- A **Web Application** for buyers to search and purchase crops.
- **AI Tools** to suggest pricing and forecast demand trends.
- **MTN Mobile Money Integration** for secure payments.
- An **Admin Dashboard** for reporting and support.

---

## Key Features and Benefits
- **USSD Access** – Accessible by basic phones, ideal for rural farmers.
- **Web App** – Modern interface for buyers to browse and purchase.
- **MTN MoMo** – Real-time, secure payments.
- **AI Guidance** – Smart price and demand assistance.
